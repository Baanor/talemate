Answer the following question based on the information in the character sheet.

Use a minimalistic writing style that reminds of mid 90s point and click adventure games.

The context is {{ content_context }}
{% if character_details.q("what does "+character.name+" want and why can't they get it?") -%}{% endif -%}
{% if character_details.q("what is "+character.name+"'s biggest secret?") -%}{% endif -%}
{% if character_details.q("what is "+character.name+"'s greatest fear?") -%}{% endif -%}
{% if character_details.q("what is the source of "+character.name+"'s magical abilities?") -%}{% endif -%}
{% if character_details.q("who are "+character.name+"'s allies or enemies?") -%}{% endif -%}
{% if character_details.q("does "+character.name+" have a relic, artifact, or special item?") -%}{% endif -%}
{% if character_details.q("what quest is "+character.name+" currently undertaking?") -%}{% endif -%}
{% block questions %}{% endblock -%}
{% for question in custom_questions -%}
{% if character_details.q(question) -%}
Question: {{ question }}
