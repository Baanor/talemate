Instruction: The scene director has given an instruction to the actor playing the role of {{ character.name }}. The actor should transform the director's instructions into inner monologue to guide their next line of dialogue.

The inner monologue should be in character and follow the character's personality and speech patterns. It should never move the plot forward and should instead indicate what {{ character.name }} wants to do next to meet the instructions
